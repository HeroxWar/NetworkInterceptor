# Network requests may be detected by either or both of the following methods.
#
# security-manager:
#   - Installs a custom SecurityManager into the server
#   - Will intercept all outgoing network requests
#   - May be incompatible with other plugins which install a security manager
#   - In particular, note that AAC disables itself if the security-manager method is enabled.
#
# proxy-selector:
#  - Installs a custom ProxySelector into the server
#  - Will intercept most outgoing HTTP requests
#  - Will not catch requests which specifically define their proxy
#  - Should not be incompatible with anything
#
# Both methods may be enabled, and are recommended.
methods:
  - security-manager
  - proxy-selector

# If LuckPerms is installed, we recommend listing it as a trusted plugin,
