# NetworkInterceptor configuration
# made with <3 by Luck

# how we should intercept network requests
# any of: 'security-manager', 'proxy-selector'
#
# security-manager: - installs a custom SecurityManager into the server.
#                   - will catch all outgoing network requests
#                   - may be incompatible with other plugins which install a
#                     security manager.
#
# proxy-selector:   - installs a custom ProxySelector into the server.
#                   - will catch *most* outgoing http requests
#                   - will not catch requests which specifically define their
#                     proxy
#                   - shouldn't be incompatible with anything
#
# you can define multiple methods.
methods:
  - security-manager
  - proxy-selector

# Configures the logging aspect of the plugin
#
# - allows network requests to be logged to the console or a file
# - useful for monitoring activity and constructing blacklists (see below)
logging:

  # if logging is enabled
  enabled: true

  # if stack traces should be printed for each attempt
  # these will always be included in the file output
  include-traces: false

  # if whitelisted hosts should be excluded from logs
  ignore-whitelisted: false

  # where we should log to
  # either: 'console', 'file' or 'all'
  mode: console


# Configures the blocking aspect of the plugin
#
# - allows network requests to be blocked
# - can either use a whitelist or a blacklist approach
block:

  # if blocking is enabled
  enabled: false

  # how we should block
  # either: 'whitelist' or 'blacklist'
  mode: blacklist

  # the whitelist / blacklist
  # entries should be lowercase
