# NetworkInterceptor configuration

# Design: SlimeDog
# Implementation: drives_a_ford
# Testing: SlimeDog

# Minecraft version support: 1.17.x
#
# NetworkInterceptor was conceived when FQDNs (fully-qualified domain names) were
# sufficient to define a network connection target. Times have changed. Today,
# Mojang, Paper, and many plugins are multi-hosted. Numeric IP addresses have
# proliferated to the point that defining a connection target is complicated.
# Cloudflare creates additional complication. This redesign is intended to
# address those issues, by defining multiple ways to define the connections
# that will be monitored and blocked:
# - trusted processes list
# - trusted plugins list
# - FQDN list
#
# A note about SpigotMC premium plugins:
# loadConfig0() makes a call to api.spigotmc.org for anti-piracy protection.
# But since premium plugins are required to work without internet connections
# (per premium guidelines), the outbound call may be safely blocked.
#
# At of 2020-08-01, premium plugins we have tested included:
# - AAC
# - AACAdditionPro
# - AntiAFKPlus
# - ForceResourcepacks aka WorldResourcepacks
# - Panilla
# - PyroWeatherPro

# Network requests may be detected by either or both of the following methods.
#
# security-manager:
#   - Installs a custom SecurityManager into the server
#   - Will intercept all outgoing network requests
#   - May be incompatible with other plugins which install a security manager
#   - In particular, note that AAC disables itself if the security-manager method is enabled.
#
# proxy-selector:
#  - Installs a custom ProxySelector into the server
#  - Will intercept most outgoing HTTP requests
#  - Will not catch requests which specifically define their proxy
#  - Should not be incompatible with anything
#
# Both methods may be enabled, and are recommended.
methods:
  - security-manager
  - proxy-selector

# Processing mode is allow or deny
# In allow mode, outbound network connections to specified targets will be allowed.
# In deny mode, outbound network connections to specified targets will be denied (blocked).
# In either mode, trusted processes and plugins may be specified.
mode: deny

# Enable/disable logging of outbound network connections.
#
# Enable/disable stack traces for each connection attempt.
# Stack traces will always be included in the file output.
#
# Connection requests may be logged to the console
# or to plugins/NetworkInterceptor/intercept.log
# Options are
#   - console
#   - file
#   - all

# Configure whether fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) are mapped to their IP addresses
# This will allow calls to IP addresses that are the result of a call to a specific FQDN
# within a certain amount of time of the former.
mapping:
  enabled: true
  # The time (in ms) within which IPs are allowed to pass as per their FQDN permissions
  timer: 1000

# Enable/disable blocking.
# If blocking is disabled, logging will still occur unless disabled above.
block:
  enabled: true

# Trusted processes and plugins
# In allow mode, outbound network connections by these processes will be allowed.
# In deny mode, outbound network connections by these processes will be allowed,
# unless the target is explicitly blocked in the targets list.
#
# minecraft-version-check applies to all Minecraft variants.
# Tested variants:
# - Spigot
# - Paper
#
# plugin-version-check applies to all plugins, so targets do not need to be specified.

# Trusted plugins
# In allow mode, outbound network connections by these plugins will be allowed.
# In deny mode, outbound network connections by these plugins will be allowed,
# unless the target is explicitly blocked in the targets list.

  - none

# The target list
# Entries should be lowercase
# In allow mode, outbound network connections to these targets will be allowed.
# In deny mode, outbound network connections to these targets will be blocked.
